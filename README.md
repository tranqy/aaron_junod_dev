# Aaron Junod's Resume

I wanted to update my resume and here we are.

Feel free to fork and update if you need to do the same and like this idea.

## Technical Details

Flutter is a toolkit for creating cross plaform apps. Flutter recently added web support. 

This app is deployed to [my server](https://aaron.junod.dev).

Flutter apps start in /lib/main.dart.
/lib/components has most of the layout code.
Content should be centralized in aaron_resume_contents.dart.

My resume is also available in [the play store](http://google.com) (soon).
