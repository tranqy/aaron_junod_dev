# Aaron Junod's Resume

I wanted to update my resume and here we are.

Feel free to fork and update if you need to do the same and like this idea.

## Technical Details

Flutter is a toolkit for creating cross plaform apps. Flutter recently added web support. 

This app is deployed to [my server](https://aaron.junod.dev).

Flutter apps start in /lib/main.dart.
/lib/components has most of the layout code.
Content should be centralized in aaron_resume_contents.dart.

## Todo

- [ ] Remaining responsive text wrapping
- [ ] Add a mobile breakpoint and resize some things, or use the offset trick from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afBmGC63iIQ).
- [ ] PDF Download
- [ ] Color chooser

~~My resume is also available in [the play store](http://google.com)~~ (soon).
